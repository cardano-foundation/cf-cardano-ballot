# Overview
  Cardano Ballot is a user-friendly, hybrid on- and off-chain voting system developed by the Cardano Foundation.  Cardano Ballot leverages a set of backend services combined with frontend applications to facilitate voting within the Cardano Ecosystem.
  
  Most recently, stake-based voting was introduced into Cardano Ballot inorder to support IOG with CIP-1694 Pre-ratification polling events.  Currently, Cardano Ballot supports user-based (1 x user, 1 x vote) and stake-based (weighted) voting events.  The modularised backend services make the process of organising, deploying, and auditing a Cardano Ballot event more decentralized and user-friendly.

  In 2023, Hydra and Aiken Smart Contracts were also introduced into Cardano Ballot.  The first implementation of this was a final Hydra tally of all votes submitted for the Cardano Summit Awards 2023.

# Getting Started

## Requirements
- Node.js 18.x LTS
- Java 17 LTS
- Postgres DB 14.x or H2 file db (local development / community running)
- Docker


## Repository Structure
- [backend-services](backend-services) - Contains various backend services:
  - [hydra-tally-app](backend-services/user-verification-service) - A CLI application which contains logic to connect to the Hydra network. Application demonstrates usage of smart contracts (Aiken) to perform counting (tally) of the votes and providing results.
  - [user-verification-service](backend-services/user-verification-service) - A Spring Boot application that verifies user wallets using their phone number (via SMS OTP one time password) or Discord account.
  - [vote-commitment-app](backend-services/vote-commitment-app) - Service that reads active events from ledger-follower-service and individual votes 
from database constructs merkle tree and at periodic, configurable intervals sends it to the Cardano blockchain.
  - [voting-admin-app](backend-services/voting-admin-app) - Application to be used by the organisers to create events and proposals.
  - [voting-app](backend-services/voting-app) - Voting Application that allows users to submit votes, receive vote receipts, and access leaderboard data.
  - [voting-ledger-follower-app](backend-services/voting-ledger-follower-app) - Ledger Follower Application that is listening to the Cardano blockchain to fetch information about event data and user stake amounts in case of stake-based voting.
  - [voting-verification-app](backend-services/voting-verification-app) - Application to be used by the community / voters to independently verify and check vote proofs.

- [ui](ui) - Contains React applications for Cardano Ballopt event user interfaces:
  - [cip-1694](ui/cip-1694) - Frontend application for the CIP-1694 pre-ratification polling event.
  - [summit-2023](ui/summit-2023) - Frontend application for the Cardano Summit 2023 Awards voting.
  - [verification-app](ui/verification-app) - A generic frontend application for the verification / validation of the vote proof within a certain Cardano Ballot Event.

## Creating a Cardano Ballot Event
### Voting Admin App
By default all backend apps are working with Cardano Pre-Production network.

```shell
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/voting-admin-app
./gradlew bootRun
```

Instructions on how to create a new voting event can be found [here](./backend-services/voting-admin-app/EVENT_REGISTRATION.md).

## Running the Backend Services
### Ledger Follower
By default all backend apps are working with Cardano Pre-Production network.

```shell
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/voting-ledger-follower-app
./gradlew bootRun
```
This will launch main voting-ledger-follower-app on port: 9090 by default.
For a detailed description and interactive interface of the API, visit the Swagger UI documentation here:
[http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/index.html)

### Voting App
```shell
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/voting-app
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will launch main voting-app on port: 9091 by default.
For a detailed description and interactive interface of the API, visit the Swagger UI documentation here:
[http://localhost:9091/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:9091/swagger-ui/index.html)

### Voting Verification
```shell
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/voting-verification-app
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will launch voting-verification-app on port: 9092 by default.
For a detailed description and interactive interface of the API, visit the Swagger UI documentation here:
[http://localhost:9092/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:9092/swagger-ui/index.html)

Instructions on how to run the `Vote Verification` app can be found [here](./backend-services/voting-verification-app/README.md).

### Voting Commitment App
```bash
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/vote-commitment-app
cp .env.template .env
# Update .env with required values (e.g. organiser's mnemonic)
# Run the service locally via:
./gradlew bootRun
```

### User Verification App
```bash
export AWS_SNS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SNS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/user-verification-service
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will launch user-verification-app on port: 9093 by default.
[http://localhost:9093/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:9093/swagger-ui/index.html)

**Note: user-verification-service is only needed for Cardano Summit 2023.**

**Note: binding PORT can be changed via SERVER_PORT env variable.**

e.g.
```
SERVER_PORT=8888 ./gradlew bootRun
```

Use `setupProxy.js` to proxy services urls. 

## Running the Frontend (User Interface)
Copy the [`.env.example`](ui/summit-2023/.env.example) file and rename it as `.env`. 

Then run:

```shell
cd cf-cardano-ballot/ui/summit-2023
cp .env.example .env
npm i
npm run start
```

## Backend -> Frontend Types Generation
All backend apps will generate TypeScript types for the frontend by using the following command:

As an example:
```shell
cd cf-cardano-ballot/backend-services/voting-app
./gradlew buildAndCopyTypescriptTypes -Pui_project_name=summit-2023
```
This will generate TypeScript types in the ui/summit-2023/build/typescript-generator/voting-app-types.ts


For your own project you will need to replace summit-2023 with your respective project ui directory name.
