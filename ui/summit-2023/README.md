# Overview

Summit 2023 UI application has been developed using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), [MUI](https://mui.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/). This frontend application features mainly Category, Nominee and Leaderboard pages by interfacing with our backend services, through a Rest API. The application also integrates Web3 component [Cardano Connect with Wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-connect-with-wallet) for user registration.

You can visit now the website that hosts this app using [this link](https://voting.summit.cardano.org/).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

This will install all packages in node_modules folder.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Running backend services in localhost

To run the backend services you will need to open multiple terminals and follow this instructions:

### Terminal 1 - [Data follower app](/backend-services/vote-commitment-app/) on port: 9090
Edit ``application.properties``:
1. Comment CIP-1694 Pre Ratification start block.
2. Uncomment CF Summit 2023 start block
```bash
cd voting-ledger-follower-app
./gradlew bootRun

```
### Terminal 2 - [Voting app](/backend-services/voting-app/) on port: 9091
```bash
cd voting-app
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Terminal 3 - [Vote verification app](/backend-services/voting-verification-app/) on port: 9092
```bash
cd voting-verification-app
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Terminal 4 - [User verification app](/backend-services/user-verification-service/) on port: 9093
```bash
export AWS_SNS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SNS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
cd user-verification-service
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Content Mapping

The UI application populates the content (Presentation Names, Urls, Description, Links etc...) from a JSON by mapping Category ids and Proposal ids which were generated by Backend service.

The current ```summit-2023``` application's content is fetching from [this JSON](src/common/resources/data/summit2023Content.json).
